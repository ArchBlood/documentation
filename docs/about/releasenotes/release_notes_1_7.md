## Released October 2020 (In Progress)

### Stream enhancements

#### New Stream Entry Layout

Streams as the dashboard or space stream are integral components of the HumHub platform. HumHub 1.7 comes with many 
stream improvements and an additional wall entry layout. Prior to HumHub 1.7 all types of content share the same 
stream layout with author image and name. For collaborative content types as for example a Wiki Page however the author
is rather secondary and should not be emphasized since Wiki Pages are maintained and edited by multiple users. The new
wall entry layout will emphasize the content type and content title instead.

#### Emphasized short text posts

Posts with only a short text used to look rather poor and the actual text was too subtle. In HumHub 1.7 short texts up to
150 characters will be rendered with a higher font size and therefore will now be more visible.

#### Less bloated stream entry layout

We replaced most of the badges used in the wall entry head section with icons and a descriptive tooltip. Topics are
not rendered under the head section which looks cleaner especially on mobile devices.

#### Reworked comment section

We've reduced the user image size of comments in order to further emphasize the content of the comment.

#### File preview improvements

The stream attachment preview section was improved by using a grid view for attached files as images and videos.

a more appealing default color scheme and furthermore improve the accessibility in terms of text color contrast.
