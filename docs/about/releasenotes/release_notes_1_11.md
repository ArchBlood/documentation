## Release April 2022

#### Introducing the new marketplace

Our marketplace received an extensive redesign. With the release we introduce our new marketplace "cards" with a fresh look and the many modules of our partners will be displayed clearer. This way it makes it easier for you to find what you are looking for. Our new filters will also help you to find specific modules faster. And there is one more thing: Updating your modules will be time-saving from now on. All modules with available updates can be updated with one click (update all).

#### New confirmation request for embedded content

Before external content (for example Youtube videos) will be displayed in your HumHub you and every single user will be asked for your explicit permission. We have implemented this for privacy reasons. We care a lot about data protection and don´t want you to be shown content you don´t want to see. You can save your settings by marking the checkbox so you don't have to give your consent again every time.

#### Forbidden usernames and notifications about deleted content

With the new release we have also created the possibility for you to define forbidden usernames. Certain terms and words can be blocked by the admin. This can be done via the configuration and the new feature makes it possible to exclude unwanted or offensive usernames. We did that because a big part of our vision at HumHub is to build a great community and networks that connect people and thrive an environment where everyone is welcoming and respectful. Another feature that comes with our version 1.11 is the possibility for admins to leave a comment on deleted posts why this particular content was deleted. This avoids confusion in case that content has to be deleted.

#### And more...

- Posts get own URLs and links (so far posts were only shown in the stream)
- Display who invited users on the approval page
- Profile fields can now be prefixes (for example "tel://")
- New oEmbed support for other social networks (like Twitter) and services requiring an API key (like Facebook)
- Followers are now being displayed at the "About" page
- LDAP: Reset mapping for single user only
- Mentioning (@user) was implemented, mentioned users receive a notification
- "Send comment" button was improved and repositioned, previously overlapped with other objects
